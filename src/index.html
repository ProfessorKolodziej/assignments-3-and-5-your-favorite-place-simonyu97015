        <h1>Ginzan Onsen</h1>
		<h2>Yamagata Prefecture | Japan</h2>
        <p>Ginzan Onsen is a hot spring area in Obanazawa, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. Its name means "silver mine hot spring". Ginzan Onsen's economy grew due to silver mining and production and eventually transitioned to tourism when it opened dozens of hot spring resorts and ryokan along the central river that runs through the town. The mountains that surround this town yield rich hot spring water that is used both in the private hotels and public baths in the city center.</p>
